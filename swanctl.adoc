== swanctl.conf

The `*swanctl --load*` commands read connections, secrets and IP address pools
from xref:swanctlConf#[`*swanctl.conf*`], located in the
xref:swanctlDirectory#[swanctl configuration directory], usually _/etc/swanctl_.

Since version:5.7.0 the loaded file may be specified for each command explicitly
via @--file@ argument (e.g. to use separate files for connections and credentials),
and since version:5.7.2 the default directory for the file and
[[swanctlDirectory|the credentials]] may be set via @SWANCTL_DIR@ environment variable.

== Credential directories

The @--load-creds@ command also reads file based credentials, such as private keys
and certificates, from a set of pre-defined sub-directories of the
[[swanctlDirectory|swanctl configuration directory]].

Since version:5.7.2 the [[swanctlDirectory|credential directories]] are accessed
relative to the actually loaded [[swanctl.conf]] file (see above) and the default
directory may be changed at runtime via @SWANCTL_DIR@ environment variable.
